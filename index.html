      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at Northwestern University, and I have a Master’s degree in Public Health from UCLA. My research lies at the intersection of medicine, law, culture, and science and technology studies (STS). My dissertation, “Legal Mobilization in Medicine: Seeking Rights to Justice and Rights to Healthcare for Survivors of Sexual Violence Globally since the 1970s,” traces the historical emergence and transnational uptake of the sexual assault medical forensic exam or SAMFE (commonly known as a “rape kit”) as a tool of anti-rape advocacy. Bringing together approaches in medical sociology, socio-legal studies, cultural sociology, and STS, I analyze the SAMFE as a hybrid medico-legal object that joins law and medicine as a novel form of medical action. I follow the object from its emergence amidst anti-rape activism in the United States beginning in the 1970s, to its uptake and codification as best practice globally in international guidelines, to more recent attempts to adapt it for use in conflict zones. To do so, I draw on the method of “process tracing” to chart an historical sequence of events to explain a particular outcome: the joining of clinical medicine and criminal law in the SAMFE for the purposes of institutional reform and its effects in domestic and humanitarian contexts. Combining archival research, fieldwork at international meetings, and over 40 in-depth interviews of healthcare practitioners, activists, lawyers, and other experts, I argue that medical evidence collection techniques help to define what they purport to measure, thereby having profound symbolic and material effects on the credibility of victims’ narratives, which crimes are deemed justiciable, and ultimately how events come to be remembered.</p>
